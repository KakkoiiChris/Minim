# Minim
A minimalist, low-level, imperative, and procedural esolang.

Minim employs a 0-indexed memory space, gotos/labels/jumps, dual types, manual memory management, value-by-value I/O, and many other similarly low-level features to create a programming experience that can go from extremely frustrating to extremely rewarding in an instant!
